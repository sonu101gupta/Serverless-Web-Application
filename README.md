This project is a serverless web application that calculates the square of a number and stores the output result in DynamoDB. The application leverages AWS services such as Lambda functions, IAM for security management, API Gateway for endpoint management, DynamoDB for database storage, and Amplify for the overall deployment and management of the application.

# # Author
This website was created by Sonu Gupta. As the developer of this application, I aimed to provide a simple and efficient way to calculate the square of numbers using serverless architecture on AWS.

# # Features
Calculate Square: Users can input a number through the provided interface and get its square as an output.
DynamoDB Storage: All computed results are stored in DynamoDB for future reference.
Technologies Used
AWS Lambda: Used for executing the number squaring function.
AWS IAM: Manages security by controlling access to AWS services.
API Gateway: Provides a RESTful API to interact with the application.
DynamoDB: Stores the input numbers and their squared results.
AWS Amplify: Facilitates the deployment and management of the entire application.
# # Getting Started
To run this application locally or deploy it to your AWS environment, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
Set Up AWS Services: Configure IAM roles, create DynamoDB tables, and set up Lambda functions.
Deploy with Amplify: Use Amplify to deploy the application to your AWS account.
Access the Application: Once deployed, access the provided URL to use the application.
# # Usage
Access the application through the provided URL.
Enter a number in the designated field.
Click the "Calculate" button to compute the square of the number.
The result will be displayed on the screen and stored in DynamoDB.
# # Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you find issues or want to enhance the application, feel free to open a pull request or create an issue in the repository.
